## What is it?
Vulture is a project management tool focused on development teams. It includes a simple to use kanban board along with a page to view project statistics on graphs. Management sections for users with access roles of Admin or above are available to use to manage members and update project settings.

Vulture is built with:
Client-Side | Server-Side
-------- | -------
CSS | NodeJS
Javascript | Express
⠀| MongoDB
⠀| Pug
⠀| Mongoose

## Framework and API
#### Framework
The backend of Vulture uses the MVC framework. I chose this because it effectively structures the managing of data, presentation and responses of the web application.

#### API
A RESTful API has been implemented as it provides flexibility for the server in terms of modifying data and is very effective when scaling software due to the large amount of requests which can be sent at a time from different devices.

## Client Side
I use Pug for server-side rendering, which sends formatted HTML to the client. I use pure JS for my pages.

## Demo Account
Use the following credentials to access a demo account:

## Code and Files
Vulture is likely to be open source in the future.
